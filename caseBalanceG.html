                <h2>TAKEAWAYS</h2>
                <p>
                    With this being my <span id="highlightTxt">first design project in a team</span> I gained a lot of
                    insight into the intricacies of
                    working within a team. During the project <span id="highlightTxt">I was responsible for
                        evaluation</span>, this meant that I
                    <span id="highlightTxt">planned
                        and developed methods</span> for <span id="highlightTxt">generating
                        data</span> relating to the user experience (UX) of the artefact. I was also <span
                        id="highlightTxt">responsible for
                        planning and
                        developing the interview guides</span> for the project.
                    <br><br>
                    I learned how <span id="highlightTxt">hard it is to create interview guides</span> from scratch, and
                    how something that seems so
                    simple
                    can take <span id="highlightTxt">a lot of time to get right</span>. The same is true for creating
                    <span id="highlightTxt">methods of evaluation
                        for the <i>original artefact</i></span>. As well
                    as the improved iterations created by the project team. Therefore <span id="highlightTxt">I
                        garnished a lot of knowledge</span> of
                    how
                    to use and <span id="highlightTxt">modify existing evaluation criteria</span> for artefacts and
                    <span id="highlightTxt">interview guide templates</span>.
                    <br><br>
                    I also quickly came to <span id="highlightTxt">the realisation that what the brief says</span> is
                    needed for a specific project,
                    <span id="highlightTxt">isn't
                        always necessarily true</span>. What <span id="highlightTxt">the brief</span> says the client
                    needs <span id="highlightTxt">is often colored with the bias of the
                        client</span> and as a design team each member
                    has to take on the responsibility of examining the brief critically with an observing eye.
                    <br><br>
                    I came to <span id="highlightTxt">the realisation that there's not always major differences in
                        users' needs for information
                        based on their age</span>. But the needs, at least in this case, <span id="highlightTxt">had
                        granular differences</span>. <span id="highlightTxt">Older users</span>
                    wanted
                    to have a
                    <span id="highlightTxt">deeper emotional connection with the
                        trainers</span>, whilst <span id="highlightTxt">younger users</span> didn't have this need and
                    mostly <span id="highlightTxt">wanted to know more about the
                        practical
                        aspects</span> of the concepts.
                    <br><br>
                    With this being my first design project <span id="highlightTxt">I gained a deeper understanding of
                        how there's no perfect
                        design
                        solution</span>. And no matter how long you spend on a design solution <span
                        id="highlightTxt">the design will never be
                        perfect</span>.
                    Furthermore <span id="highlightTxt">I understood how hard it
                        is to design a solution</span> when you're <span id="highlightTxt">not in close contact with the
                        client</span>. But I also realised that
                    <span id="highlightTxt">you
                        can't put the project on hold for too long</span> even if it's hard to get a hold of your client
                    because <span id="highlightTxt">at
                        the
                        end of the day you still have
                        to deliver a solution</span>, whether or not the client was involved or not.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, and probably my biggest takeaway, <span id="highlightTxt">I learned a lot about how to
                        gather and analyse data</span>.
                    Both
                    how to continuously analyse and themathise interviewees answers during an interview or evaluation,
                    as
                    well as analysing and themathising
                    large datasets from interviews. This is something that is quite <span id="highlightTxt">time
                        consuming and hard</span> to be
                    efficient
                    at. But <span id="highlightTxt">to me</span>,
                    it's very <span id="highlightTxt">stimulating and very fun</span>. I came to the realisation that
                    <span id="highlightTxt">i love analysing and seeing
                        abstract
                        patterns in data</span> relating to users
                    thoughts, feelings and actions toward certain design choices.

                <p><span id="highlightTxt"><i>Interview guides</i></span> - Designing interview guides are challenging.
                    Using guidelines when learning
                    to
                    create interview guides can help a lot. Trying to imagine possible answers to each question asked in
                    an
                    interview can help further shape a iterate the questions.
                    <br><br>
                    <span id="highlightTxt"><i>Critically analysing the brief</i></span> - Starting of by critically
                    examining the clients own
                    percevied
                    wants and need in the brief is a good starting point. Sometimes clients arent really awware of what
                    they
                    actually need to solve a specific problem.

                    same
                    needs and wants. But you have to look carefullyy for granular differences in these needs and wants,
                    because theyre almost always present.

                <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
                <p>The design team <span id="highlightTxt">began the project</span> by <span id="highlightTxt">examining
                        the brief and looking over the artefact</span> the brief was
                    based on. The team could see <span id="highlightTxt">issues with the original artefact</span> and I
                    started to <span id="highlightTxt">plan and design an
                        evaluation</span>. I ended up <span id="highlightTxt">basing the evaluation
                        on Andy Budds “Heuristics For Modern Web Application Development”</span>, and the project team
                    performed
                    the
                    evaluation together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span id="highlightTxt">After the evaluation</span> was complete the project team concluded that
                    <span id="highlightTxt">the major issue that the artefact
                        faced</span> was a less than ideal <span id="highlightTxt">informational and navigational
                        architecture</span>. The team kept
                    these things
                    in
                    mind when moving forward. We concluded that <span id="highlightTxt">we needed
                        input from users</span> regarding what information that was missing and what information that
                    was
                    superfluous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keeping the heuristic evaluation in mind <span id="highlightTxt">I started to design a interview
                        guide</span> that would help the
                    project team gain a deeper understanding of what potential users wanted to see on the website.

                <p>
                    After the initial research was done the project team wanted to <span id="highlightTxt">define a
                        sitemap with improved
                        navigational and informational architecture</span>. To do this the team used <span
                        id="highlightTxt">cardsorting with
                        potential
                        users
                        of the site</span>, <span id="highlightTxt">to gain a understanding</span> of what, to them, was
                    <span id="highlightTxt">the most intuitive way to
                        structure the
                        website</span>.
                    <br><br>
                    Next up the team <span id="highlightTxt">created a persona based on interviews</span>, this was done
                    to <span id="highlightTxt">further understand and
                        empathize with what users need and wanted</span> to see on the website.
                    <br><br>
                    After this <span id="highlightTxt">a sitemap was drafted and itterated upon</span>.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally all group members <span id="highlightTxt">drafted sketches based on the final iteration of
                        the sitemap</span>. <span id="highlightTxt">Each sketch
                        had
                        its own strength and weaknesses</span>, therefore the group <span id="highlightTxt">merged
                        different placements of elements /
                        functions
                        of the different sketches into one</span>! A Process i like calling "Frankensteining".

                    The <span id="highlightTxt">prototype was created in Figma</span>. And the project team could then
                    <span id="highlightTxt">move on to user testing</span>. I
                    developed

                <p>
                    By <span id="highlightTxt">measuring the completion time of the navigation tasks clear outliers

                    team
                    could take measures to <span id="highlightTxt">iterate the navigation even further to make it more
                        effective</span>. The <span id="highlightTxt">followup
                        questions</span> were mainly geared towards gaining a
                    deeper understanding of what the users thought about the <span id="highlightTxt">navigation oh the
