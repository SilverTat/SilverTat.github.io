                <h2>CASE BRIEF</h2>
                <p>During <span id="highlightTxt">Designstudio - smart societies</span> my project team and i worked
                    with
                    <span id="highlightTxt">LBVA and VIVAB</span>, two municipally
                    sponsored companies that act as <span id="highlightTxt">water managers for Halmstad, Laholm and
                        Falkenbergs</span> municipals. The
                    brief, provided by LBVA and VIVAB,
                    expressed a need to <span id="highlightTxt">change user habits and attitudes towards the use of
                        freshwater</span>, a.k.a. drinking
                    /
                    tap
                    water.
                </p>
                <p>
                    LBVA and VIVAB wanted to <span id="highlightTxt">make actors</span> such as, private individuals and
                    companies <span id="highlightTxt">conscious of
                        freshwater
                        as a finite resource</span> and as a prerequisite for all life to function normally. This
                    involved making
                    actors <span id="highlightTxt">stop wasting freshwater</span> on, e.g.
                    cleaning their cars.

                <p>
                    LBVA and VIVAB had <span id="highlightTxt">previously co-founded a another project</span>. The
                    goal of the project
                    was to develop a tool to <span id="highlightTxt">map actor's water usage</span>. This, along with a
                    project report, was
                    <span id="highlightTxt">handed
                        over to us</span> at the begining at the project for further development.

                <h2>RESULTS</h2>
                <p>After a lot of iterations the design resulted in a <span id="highlightTxt">satisfactory visual
                        artefact</span>, with further room for
                    improvement. But it would function as <span id="highlightTxt">a concept for further
                        development</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Serveral different <span id="highlightTxt">service design methods</span> were used throughout the
                    project.
                    <span id="highlightTxt">Three customer journeys</span> were developed to represent different stages
                    of
                    implementation.
                    <span id="highlightTxt">The first</span> of these were a customer journey presenting how a user
                    would navigate
                    <span id="highlightTxt">the
                        service today</span>.
                    <span id="highlightTxt">The second</span> journey was based on <span id="highlightTxt">future
                        implementation efforts and
                        systems planned
                        by
                        LBVA & VIVAB</span>.
                    <span id="highlightTxt">The third</span> journey was dubbed <span id="highlightTxt">"preffered
                        future state"</span> and tried to

                <p>
                    The final solution consisted of:

                <h2>TAKEAWAYS</h2>
                <p>
                    During this design studio I learned how hard it can be to <span id="highlightTxt">not tunnel
                        vision</span> once the
                    design process has already started. The project group <span id="highlightTxt">initially wanted to
                        design a service</span> based on
                    <span id="highlightTxt">current measures being taken by LBVA and
                        VIVAB</span>, however this <span id="highlightTxt">did not fulfil the course goals</span> and it
                    was hard to shift focus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also learned a lot more about <span id="highlightTxt">service design</span> and what <span
                        id="highlightTxt">methods</span> might be suited to which parts of a
                    design process.

                </p>
                <p>
                    I gained further knowledge in <span id="highlightTxt">project managing within a smaller
                        subgroup</span> of a project and how to
                    properly <span id="highlightTxt">communicate relevant and important topics</span> of discussion
                    within
                    different teams in a
                    larger
                    project.

                <p><i><span id="highlightTxt">Tunnel vision</span></i> - Breaking free from tunnel vision can be hard
                    once the design process is already
                    started.
                </p>

                <p><i><span id="highlightTxt">Service design methods</span></i> - Service deisn methods are often very
                    complex and hard to
                    understand. But they can be immensly usefull when designing and explaining a concept!

                <p><i><span id="highlightTxt">Managing projects</span></i> - Leading a smaller subgroup focused, mostly,
                    on the service design of
                    the project gave me further appreciation for project managers. Having a constant overview of what is
                    being done and if deadlines are being met can be stressfull. But if done right is an adequatley
                    challenging and fun task!

                        agreed upon</span> or accepted <span id="highlightTxt">definition</span> of water
                    smartness established. The group came to the conclusion that this is most likely <span
                        id="highlightTxt">due to lacking
                        interest</span>
                    and the subject <span id="highlightTxt">not being addressed properly</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project team decided to <span id="highlightTxt">conduct a <i>omvärldsanalys</i></span> to
                    <span id="highlightTxt">explore other countries perspectives</span> on water and how they handle
                    their freshwater supplies.
                    Thus we <span id="highlightTxt">studdied different initiatives</span> from other countries and <span
                        id="highlightTxt">how they their freshwater supplies
                        in a sustainable way</span>. Academic literature and other information channels across the web
                    were used. The
                    <span id="highlightTxt">project report from COWI</span> supplied by LBVA and VIVAB was also used for
                    this research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the research the project group observed that <span id="highlightTxt">small and medium
                        companies</span> said they were
                    <span id="highlightTxt">willing to
                        become more conscious of their freshwater usage,</span> and in turn, become more watersmart but
                    that <span id="highlightTxt">they
                        did
                        not know how to</span>. We also observed, what we
                    defined as, a <span id="highlightTxt">conscious or unconscious ignorance</span> within companies
                    regarding “water smartness”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally we observed that most of the <span id="highlightTxt">information pertaining to
                        “watersmartness”</span> were found in
                    <span id="highlightTxt">academic
                        articles / literature and global agendas</span>. Further most <span id="highlightTxt">measures
                        were designed for private
                        households</span>. In
                    short we observed a plethora of measures that
                    private households could take to become more “watersmart” but also observed a <span
                        id="highlightTxt">lack of measures
                        designed
                        for companies</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To garner <span id="highlightTxt">further insights</span> of the water consumption and water
                    consciousness of companies the project
                    team developed an <span id="highlightTxt">interview guide</span>. <span id="highlightTxt">Through
                        the interviews</span> we concluded that most
                    companies had a clear overview <span id="highlightTxt">of how the companies
                        used their water</span>, but they <span id="highlightTxt">couldn't answer</span> questions
                    regarding <span id="highlightTxt">how much water specific parts of
                        their
                        facilities consumed</span>. When the companies were questioned about if the had taken any <span
                        id="highlightTxt">measures to
                        become
                        more “watersmart”</span> the companies
                    mentioned more general <span id="highlightTxt">measures like water-saving faucets</span>, but
                    nothing company specific.

                <p>
                    We <span id="highlightTxt">divided the project group into two different teams</span>, one that would
                    <span id="highlightTxt">develop the artefact</span> that
                    was
                    <span id="highlightTxt">primarily designed for the users of the water</span> <i>and not LBVA and
                        VIVAB</i> and another one that would
                    <span id="highlightTxt">develop
                        the service</span> behind the artefact.
                    Each group also had a member that would act as a <span id="highlightTxt">project manager within the
                        teams</span>. I
                    was appointed as head of the service design group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both teams had <span id="highlightTxt">daily scrums to keep eachother updated</span> on what they
                    were working on and how far into
                    the
                    process each group had gotten. These scrums also served to make sure that the direction either team
                    was taking was in line with what the other team had in mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This lead to the development of <span id="highlightTxt">three different customer journeys</span>,
                    one for the <span id="highlightTxt">current state</span>, <span id="highlightTxt">future
                        state</span> and one called <span id="highlightTxt">preferred future state</span>. The <span
                        id="highlightTxt">current
                        state customer journey</span> was <span id="highlightTxt">based on
                        existing
                        artefacts</span> already implemented by LBVA and VIVAB
                    and different actors. The <span id="highlightTxt">future state customer journey was based on
                        measures that are currently
                        being
                        implemented</span> and what could be done to further their usefulness in making actors more
                    conscious of
                    their
                    freshwater usage. And finally
                    the <span id="highlightTxt">preferred future state customer journey was created to visualise an
                        ideal
                        customer journey</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <span id="highlightTxt">scenario was then created</span> based on the <span
                        id="highlightTxt">preferred future state customer journey</span>, as a sort of short
                    novel. The <span id="highlightTxt">scenario had the purpose of explaining the customer
                        journey</span> in depth and more
                    pedagogically.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A <span id="highlightTxt">service blueprint</span> could then enter development <span
                        id="highlightTxt">based on</span> the <span id="highlightTxt">customer journey</span> and the
                    <span id="highlightTxt">scenario</span>. The
                    service blueprint was meant to give LBVA and VIVAB a <span id="highlightTxt">clear overview</span>
                    of how the <span id="highlightTxt">technical parts</span> of
                    the
                    service <span id="highlightTxt">would work together with employees</span> developing
                    company specific measures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <span id="highlightTxt">business model canvas</span> was the developed to concretely explain to
                    LBVA and VIVAB how the service
                    would
                    <span id="highlightTxt">deliver value to them</span>, <span id="highlightTxt">consumers of
                        freshwater and society as whole</span>, framed from a climate
                    perspective.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A <span id="highlightTxt">service roadmap</span> was also developed to help LBVA and VIVAB <span
                        id="highlightTxt">start development and implementation</span> of
                    the
                    service.

                <p>
                    A <span id="highlightTxt">service specification</span> was also developed to give a high fidelity
                    explanation of what and <span id="highlightTxt">how different parts</span> of the service
                    roadmap were to <span id="highlightTxt">be developed and implemented</span>. As well as explaining
                    more in depth what the different
                    “sprints” in the service roadmap entailed and why they were important.

                <h2>PROTOTYPING</h2>
                <p>
                    The project group started working on a <span id="highlightTxt">visual artefact</span> that actors
                    would interact with when using
                    the
                    service. <span id="highlightTxt">Before prototyping</span> of the UI could begin the project group
                    started of by doing more
                    <span id="highlightTxt">research</span>
                    about how <span id="highlightTxt">similar artefacts was designed</span>
                    around the world. A <span id="highlightTxt">particularly fruitfull</span> area of study was <span
                        id="highlightTxt">energy
                        consumption</span> and how this was
                    presented in a user friendly way. We quickly realised that energy consumption was <span
                        id="highlightTxt">often presented</span> in
                    <span id="highlightTxt">graphs and energy curves</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this in mind the <span id="highlightTxt">subgroup responsible for the visual artefact</span>
                    initially
                    <span id="highlightTxt">created an
                        artefact for the service</span>. The artefact contained various <span
                        id="highlightTxt">visualisations of a company's
                        freshwater
                        usage</span>
                    in the form of <span id="highlightTxt">2D graphs</span>. <span id="highlightTxt">Something i quickly
                        voiced my opinion
                        on</span>. Since <span id="highlightTxt">water quantities</span> is <span
                        id="highlightTxt">generally communicated</span> in <span id="highlightTxt">cubic

                    thought it <span id="highlightTxt">more intuitive to show 3D graphs</span> instead of 2D ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, it should be mentioned that my subrgoup; <span id="highlightTxt">the service design

                        id="highlightTxt">the artefact was refined further</span>. As an
                    example
                    we <span id="highlightTxt">garnered insights</span> on how to <span id="highlightTxt">present
                        water consumption intuitiveley</span>. Due to <span id="highlightTxt">water often</span> being
                    <span id="highlightTxt">measured in three dimensions</span> and not two dimensions
                    the project group decided to use <span id="highlightTxt">3D graphs</span> for representation of the
                    water usage <span id="highlightTxt">instead of 2D
                        graphs</span>.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The initial <span id="highlightTxt">information architecture</span> was also <span
                        id="highlightTxt">changed</span> due to the artefact being <span id="highlightTxt">perceived as
                        overwhelming and boring</span>. The project group also performed a type of <span
                        id="highlightTxt">cardsorting to explore</span> how users
                    would want their <span id="highlightTxt">water usage presented</span> to them in this type
                    of artefact. In the cardsorting <span id="highlightTxt">participants had to sort</span>
                    <span id="highlightTxt">predetermined elements</span> that would be
                    part
                    <span id="highlightTxt">of the artefact</span>, however they see fit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <span id="highlightTxt">cardsorting resulted</span> in further <span
                        id="highlightTxt">insights</span> of how the <span id="highlightTxt">informational
                        architecture</span> <span id="highlightTxt">should be
                        designed</span>
                    within the artefact. After <span id="highlightTxt">serveral evaluations</span> of the first two
                    prototypes a <span id="highlightTxt">final design was reached</span>.

                <h2>FINAL ARTEFACT</h2>
                <p>The <span id="highlightTxt">designstudio resulted</span> in a <span id="highlightTxt">plethora of
                        service design tools</span> <span id="highlightTxt">for
                        development and implementation</span> of

                    <span id="highlightTxt"><i>First, two artefacts</i></span> for the
                    service concept. <span id="highlightTxt">One was developed</span>
                    for
                    the web,
                    with <span id="highlightTxt">PC’s and laptops in mind</span>. <span id="highlightTxt">The
                        other was developed as a mobile application</span>. The project group
                    decided that <span id="highlightTxt">the artefact developed for the web</span> would
                    <span id="highlightTxt">present more in depth data</span> regarding water consumption due to the,
                    generally, larger screen real
                    estate
                    available on PC’s and laptops. Meanwhile <span id="highlightTxt">the app</span>, designed with
                    phones in mind, would <span id="highlightTxt">present the
                        most
                        important data</span>, but less data
                    as a whole.

                <p>
                    <span id="highlightTxt"><i>Second, business model canvas</i></span> was drafted to <span
                        id="highlightTxt">clearly convey</span>

                    roadmap
                    spanned a <span id="highlightTxt">total of eight years</span> but efforts to
                    implement such a large scale service could <span id="highlightTxt">potentially be longer</span> due
                    to the sheer logistics. The
                    service
                    roadmap had <span id="highlightTxt">three major pillars of development and implementation</span>,
                    these are: <span id="highlightTxt">Digital infrastructure</span>
                    (pink/purple), <span id="highlightTxt">Physical infrastructure</span>
                    (Blue) and <span id="highlightTxt">Marketing</span> (green). Accompanied by a <span
                        id="highlightTxt"> service specification</span>, meant to explain the parts of the service
                    roadmap in depth.

                <p>
                    <span id="highlightTxt"><i>Fourth, a service blueprint</i></span> was created to <span
                        id="highlightTxt">envision how the service would work between all
                        involved
                        actors and artefacts</span> . This service blueprint was <span id="highlightTxt">based on the
                        “preferred future state customer
                        journey”</span>.
                    The service blueprint <span id="highlightTxt">presented what actions customers
                        could do</span> and <span id="highlightTxt">how these corresponded to fronstage actions</span>
                    (the employees at LBVA and VIVAB), how the
                    customers would interact with the artefacts, how <span id="highlightTxt">these interactions then
                        influenced</span> the
                    <span id="highlightTxt">backstage actions taken by the employees
                        at LBVA and VIVAB</span> and <span id="highlightTxt">finally backstage support processes handled
                        by the databases</span> of these
                    artefacts.
                </p>
                <p><span id="highlightTxt">Fifth, a system map</span> was also developed to give LBVA & VIVAB an
                    overarching understanding of how the preffered future service and its different parts would work in
                    tandem
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span id="highlightTxt"><i>Sixth, was three different customer journey maps</i></span>,
                    one was developed based on the
                    <span id="highlightTxt">current
                        service</span>. The <span id="highlightTxt">second customer journey</span> was based on <span
                        id="highlightTxt">efforts
                        currently being implemented</span> and
                    how these
                    efforts <span id="highlightTxt">could potentially</span> <span id="highlightTxt">effect
                        actors and help them</span>
                    reduce their wasteful use of the finite freshwater supply. <span id="highlightTxt">Third and
                        lastly</span>, we create a <span id="highlightTxt">“Preferred
                        future state customer journey”</span> this customer journey <span id="highlightTxt">envisioned a
                        future</span> not limited by current
                    efforts
                    already being implemented. And was needed to achive the course criteria.

                <p>
                    <span id="highlightTxt"><i>Finally the project group drafted some general guidelines</i></span> for
                    <span id="highlightTxt">further development</span> of the
                    service,
                    this
                    <span id="highlightTxt">encompassed further development</span> of the <span
                        id="highlightTxt">web</span> and <span id="highlightTxt">app</span>. <span id="highlightTxt">As
                        Well as
                        certificates</span> that would <span id="highlightTxt">need
                        development</span>. These certificates was something <span id="highlightTxt">LBVA
                        and VIVAB</span> had expressed that <span id="highlightTxt">they wanted to be able to
                        supply companies</span> who were <span id="highlightTxt">“water
                        smart”</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thus, <span id="highlightTxt">the conceptual service solution</span> had <span
                        id="highlightTxt">companies of varying sizes in mind</span> and <span id="highlightTxt">not
                        private
                        individuals / households</span>. This was <span id="highlightTxt">due to</span> the project
                    group observing that <span id="highlightTxt">a plethora of measures</span>
                    were
                    <span id="highlightTxt">available to households</span> to become more “watersmart”,
                    as well as <span id="highlightTxt">companies of varying sizes being the biggest consumers
                        freshwater</span>.
